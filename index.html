				About
			</h1>
			<p class="message">
				<strong>Welcome to the official Edens'webpage,</strong> where you can find documentations, read stories and stay informed about our beloved department.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our association is made of students from the 5 levels, freshmen till Master 2 students. In its basic foundation, the association applies no consideration of complexion, of religious matters, or of political orientation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our motto <strong>"Together as one"</strong> clearly aims at strengthening solidarity among students. Cultural activities are organized to reach that goal. <br> Those activities include :
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Gospel sessions</a></li>
					<li><a href="">Drama club</a></li>
					<li><a href="">Dancing</a></li>
					<li><a href="">Drawing club</a></li>
					<li><a href="">Thursday's English club</a></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The association encourages  also students to study hard and pedagogical activities  like ENS club quiz and workshop are organized on that purpose.
			</p>
			<h3>Organization</h3>
			<p>
				Despite the fact Edens is recognized by school administration and teachers, it has its own regulations, STAFF members and organizations
			</p>
			<p class="message">
				<strong>Edens is students association,</strong> teachers and school employees aren't concerned.
			</p>
			<p>
				The association is led by a President elected for one year-term, but
				one student can't be elected to lead the association more than
				twice.

			<h3>Brief History</h3>
			<p>
				EDENS was founded about 15 years ago. <strong>Pr Manoro,</strong> a current linguistic teacher in the English Department of ENS is one of its founders and used to be its honorary members.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its statutes were ratified in 2010 during the year-term of president Bellarmin Rakotonirina. The statute per se contains nine articles and sixteen sub-articles.
			</p>
			<h3>Our goals</h3>
			<p>
				We are committed to ensure that our members will be fulfilled during their temporary pesence at the department and be ready to be teachers who not only will teach the core language but also modern and appropriate lifestyle to malagasy children.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to reach that goals, we provide our members and whoever interested in our activities a platform of exchange and interactions.
